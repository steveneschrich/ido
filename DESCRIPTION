Description: A common problem with R in practice is that CRAN and other sites (including github)
 limit the size of a package. When considering really large datasets, or potentially controlled
 access datasets, the data package approach does not work well. There are a variety of solutions,
 including drat and stashr, which offer alternatives. Here, we provide a lightweight package that
 uses indirection (in the form of a configuration file) to redirect a typical data command to
 a secondary URL.
